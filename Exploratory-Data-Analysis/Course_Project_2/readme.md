## Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 2
## Introduction
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence 
that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions 
of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions
of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about
the NEI at the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html).

## Data
<p> PM2.5 Emissions Data (<font color="red">summarySCC_PM25.rds</font>): 
This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for 
the entire year. Here are the first few rows.</p>
